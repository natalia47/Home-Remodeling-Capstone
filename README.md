# Home-Remodeling-Capstone
Capstone Project completed in Fall 2022 as part of Masters in Data Science program at Northwestern University


Business Problem

For the purposes of this project, Remodelers R Us was established as a fictitious home remodeling company in the greater Boston area struggling to effectively generate leads or help potential clients decide if remodeling is right for them in the context of their return on investment. Our team, T51, acted as an analytics consulting firm hired by Remodelers R Us to take a data-driven approach and provide analytic solutions.

Project Objectives

T51’s objectives were to:
•	Identify viable target opportunities for near-term home remodeling in the greater Boston area
•	Answer key questions potential customers have about their remodeling decisions
•	Segment prospective customers with similar characteristics for target marketing opportunities 
•	Create software solutions powered by data analytics to visually depict opportunities

Data Sources

T51 identified publicly available property and demographic datasets to use for analysis and modeling. Data was sourced from the City of Boston’s Open Data Hub, Mass.gov, and Census.gov. Data consisted of property and building characteristics, location data, and census tract level tables of age, sex, income, and education. The data was filtered on owner-occupied single-family homes to focus efforts on homeowners rather than landlords. The final aggregated and cleaned dataset contained ~20,000 properties.
